After a great trip to the US this past November and having attended a few cool meetups that I really enjoyed such as the [Haskell Hackers event](http://www.meetup.com/haskellhackersathackerdojo/events/88293102/) at the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, I came back home to find out that my server was compromised and there was a $400 bill waiting for me for outbound data charges.

Lesson learned? Don't host your website on the same VPS you do your dev hacks on.

Bottom line is that I have managed to get credited for the period and my site is back up.
I rebuilt the site with Hakyll [1] and applied a new cleaner look in the process. Hope you enjoy!

For questions and feedback, you can drop me an email or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alenribic).
